 2 Parts 
 Part 1 = Things integrated before the midterm
 Part 2 = Things integrated during the midterm 

# Things That I Added Before Midterm

Ten shaders scripts that were all previously used/given in the lectures

I will list the shaders below
- Toon Ramp
- Diffuse
- Bump Diffuse
- Diffuse Wrap
- LUT
- Reflection
- Shader PBR
- Standard Specular PBR
- Rim Lighting
- Phong Specular (Error :/ )

I added one script that we used from the lecture that is called "ScreenCameraShader". This is used when I want to apply a lut shader to the camera. I also added a lut texture photo, and this was taken from canvas (the one provided throughout lectures).

I added one texture to the project (It was made from one of my gdw group members (Caleb B.) (I am referencing this as it was made by him and not by me. But not found from online))

I created a NormalMap for this texture as well by using the website below

https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/ 

This is everything that I have added into the unity file before hand. I added these ten shaders and two textures (One made by my GDW group member and the other created from the first texture using a normalMapping website)
